Our priority while model selection is to select a mode with  the most test precision.
That is we aim to select a model that doesnot produce any false positives.

After running both the models on a small dataset we have concluded that 
The best model found is support vector machine with 98.3% accuracy.

It classifies every non-spam message correctly (Model precision)

It classifies the 87.7% of spam messages correctly (Model recall)

Hence we will now train the model with larger dataset which will include raw data and will record the frequencies of common words and also record new words encountered.
